# commercetools Java Training Exercises

This repo contains exercises for the [commercetools JVM SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk) training. 
These exercises complement the training program, and are not intended to deliver a full understanding of commercetools by themselves.

These exercises are intended to run on your local machine. 

Training participants should finish following exercises:
- Configure and create client

- Query all tax categories
- Create a product
- Query products
- Search products
- Create a customer
- Create a cart
- Query a cart by id

Typically, the `MOODLE*.java` scripts will not be modified. Tasks require implementing the modules in `impl/` until the `MOODLE*.java` scripts show the intended behavior.
